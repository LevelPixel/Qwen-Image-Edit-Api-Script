Create a MAXIMUM photorealistic image based on the 3D image. Add a natural feel to the photograph. Time of day should be sunny. Do not change the shape of the furniture or add other furniture or furniture details. High contrast. No blown-out highlights. Medium brightness. Natural color correction. Be sure to add soft shadows to objects.

There should be no artificial 3D effect; the photo should be as photorealistic as possible.

Leave everything else as is; do not change anything.
